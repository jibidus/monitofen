# Monitofen [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci] [![Code Climate][grade-image]][grade] [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jibidus/monitofen)


## What is monitofen?

Monitofen is used to **monitor** measurements of an **Okofen boiler**.
Measurements are imported daily and are exposed through a webapp.

## Why not using [Okovision](http://okovision.dronek.com)?

Because I did not manage to install it in a Docker container, and when I tried to contribute, I was discouraged by the lack of automated tests (among others).

It is unfortunate, since `Okovision` brings a lot of interesting features.

## What can I do with Monitofen?

- Daily import of measurements
- Visualize measurements by selecting a day and a metric

## üê≥ How to test Monitofen?

See [Docker setup](doc/infra.md).

## How to install?

Here is a tutorial to [install Monitofen on Raspberry Pi OS Lite](doc/infra.md).

## How to deploy new version once installed?

```
make deploy
```

## How to import boiler measurements manually from boiler url?

```shell
rails "measurements:import[<boiler url>]"
```

Where boiler url is `http://hostname:port` (ex: `http://192.168.1.10:8080`).

Note: `[<boiler url>]` can be removed for the benefit of the `MONITOFEN_BOILER_BASE_URL` env var.

## How to import boiler measurements manually from filesystem?

```shell
rails "measurements:import[<measurements file path>]"
```

## How to contribute?

1. [Setup your local environment](doc/setup_dev.md)
2. Run tests with `make test`
3. Setup local database with `bundle exec rails db:setup`
4. Start local server with `make start`
5. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## TODO

- [ ] Docker env: reduce docker image size (see https://github.com/progapandist/anycable_rails_demo/blob/master/.dockerdev/Dockerfile.multi)
- [ ] Docker env: test image & docker-compose
- [ ] Front: filter measurements by time period
- [ ] Migrate to TypeScript
- [ ] Dev: front auto-reload
- [ ] Dev: move stats floating div on the right (and breakpoint on bottom right) 
- [ ] Vuetify dark theme
- [ ] Front tests: replace RSpec style by JUnit style
- [ ] i18n (metrics label, graph infos... start with all in english)
- [ ] Integrate linters with [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog)
- [ ] Harmonize NodeJS versions (infra doc VS Dockerfile VS ci)
- [ ] Bug: measurements importation when 1 file already imported (output is wrong)
- [ ] Bug: (chart) first hours of day are wrong ("Dev 7, 2021, 12:00:00am" instead of "Dev 7, 2021, 00:00:00am" or "Dev 6, 2021, 12:00:00am")
- [ ] Display measurements units
